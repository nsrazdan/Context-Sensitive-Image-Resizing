# Context-Sensitive Image Resizing
- This project showcases my experience with Computer Vision
- In This project, I implemented an algorithm to decrease the resolution of an image with minimal distortions to important aspects of the image.
- This is performed by calculating the path of pixels through the image with the minimum essential information.
- The essential information contained with a path of pixels is calculated primarily by its contrast with neighboring pixels
- This project is developed in Matlab with LaTex used to write up results
